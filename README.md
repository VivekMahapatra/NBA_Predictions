# Introduction

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is composed of some of the world’s top notch athletes. These athletes are placed on one of 30 NBA teams to compete for a championship. In order to get there, however, teams must win games during the regular season, which is composed of 82 games. Typically, if a team wins more than half its games (42 or more) in the regular season, there is a good chance it will make the playoffs. There are several factors to winning more than 50% of games and securing an above 0.500 record. These include shooting percentages, injuries, opponent field goal percentages, points per game, and many more advanced statistics. Our goal in this project is to analyze the various features that influence winning games and predict whether an NBA team will have an above 0.500 record, or at least 43 wins. We will rely on advanced NBA statistics from previous NBA seasons. This is a binary classification problem in which a ‘1’ signifies that the team will have an above 0.500 record, while ‘0’ signifies otherwise.

# Datasets

We will be focusing our project on the following NBA seasons: 2019–20, 2020–21, and 2021–22. We will be training using the data from the 2019–20 and 2020–21 seasons, and we will predict whether a team will have an above 0.500 record on the 2021–22 season. The data for these 3 years was collected from the following website: https://www.basketball-reference.com/. Each dataset has 30 rows to represent each of the 30 NBA teams. There are also 50 columns, which consist of both offensive and defensive stats such as points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. Here the links to where we obtained the data for the three NBA seasons from 2019 to 2022:
